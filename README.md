# MOT_Data_Analysis

This code was used to manipulate and visualise a large dataset of UK vehicle MOT test results, and to build a predictive logistic regression model for test pass rates. The dataset is publicly available here: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/anonymised_mot_test

This was for the Data Analytics module of my MSc Computer Science.
